        <p style="border:1px solid firebrick">Hi I am Mike DeAngelis and I am currently studying Cyber/Network Management at New England Institute of Technology. I live in Coventry with my family of 9 including my two dogs Fenway & Apollo, and my cat Louis. I thoroughly enjoy nature, video games, and anime! I have watched Naruto, MHA, and One Punch Man. I also like to play single-player open world games, especially games that have high amounts of foliage and ambient sounds such as Far Cry or Assassins Creed. Lastly I have always loved nature, including insects and animals. Spiders though... are the bane of my existence. </p>
