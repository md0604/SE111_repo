            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>My name is Mike DeAngelis, I am 21 years old and currently live in my parents house in Hope, Rhode Island. I am six foot seven and must say that it is extremely difficult to find clothes that actually fit me XD. I have two sisters, Hannah & Olivia, two brothers, Nick & Jake and my mom Cherie & my step-dad Rui. My biological dad, Mike DeAngelis Sr. lives in smithfield RI, and I see him very often. I have two golden retrievers, Fenway and Apollo, and my kitty, Louis. I enjoy playing sports such as hockey and volleyball. I also thoroughly enjoy playing video games when I have the time to.</p>

            <h2>Schooling</h2>

            <ol>

                <li>Coventry High School 2014-2018</li>
                <li>Rivier University 2018-2021</li>
                <li>New England Tech 2021-Present</li>

            </ol>

            <p> I attended Coventry High School from 2014 to 2018 in hopes of studying Criminal Justice in college. I started attending my dream school which was Rivier University in 2018 to 2021. After certain events with police in 2020-2021 I started shifting towards wanting to study in something more interesting to me such as Cybersecurity. The program was fairly new to Rivier so I had decided that New England Institute of Technology would be my best shot for my tech related major. I must say that I do not think there could be a better school for me. I am currently attending NEIT and love it here!</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>

            <ol>

                <li>Sports</li>
                <li>Video Games</li>
                <li>Music</li>

            </ol>

            <p>As stated in my "About me" I love sports. I have been playing Ice Hockey for 16 years and am a jotun on skates. Volleyball has become a neccesity in my life and I have been playing since freshman year of high school to the present. I am a middle but can play outside as well. When attending Rivier University I played volleyball for the three years of being there and got to experience winning a GNACC championship with my team which was one of the most exciting moments in my life.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>I am a sucker for video games. My favorite video games are definitely Minecraft and Skyrim. Assassins Creed Valhalla has made its way to the top of the list recently as I am in love with norse mythology and getting to experience these myths first-hand.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Music is my zen. Without it I would be an empty husk with no rythm. I was in Select Chorus in high school. I love singing, whether its in the car, shower, or just in any setting. My mind is always thinking of different beats as well as lyrics I could some day turn into music of my own. My favorite band is AJR who are three brothers that continue to make the best alternative music.(heavily biased ;D)</p>
